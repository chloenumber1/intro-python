# 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, 
# but instead of just printing each person’s name, 
# print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, 
# but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

# Start with the list from 3-1:
names = ["Susie", "Sue", "Goblin", "Aaron"]
# Print each message with the elements:
print(f"Hello there, {names[0]}")
print(f"Hello there, {names[1]}")
print(f"Hello there, {names[2]}")
print(f"Hello there, {names[3]}")
