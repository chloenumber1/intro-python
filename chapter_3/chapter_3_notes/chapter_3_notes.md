**Ch.3 Introducing Lists**

**3.1 What is a List**
- Refer to [e1_bicycles.py]() for code examples for 3.1.1 through 3.1.4
- *3.1.1 Defining a List*: 
    - 3.1.1.1 A list is a Python data structure that is a mutable ordered sequence of elements.
    - 3.1.1.2 A set of square brackets ([]) indicate a list
    - 3.1.1.3 List elements are separated by commas
    - 3.1.1.3 Example syntax: my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
- *3.1.2 Accessing Elements in a List*:
    - 3.1.2.1 Using an Index: An index is the position of an element in a list. If you want to access an element in the list, use the syntax list_name[1]. 
    - 3.1.2.2 Using an Index and Method: You can add a method on an element you're accessing. Ex. print(list_name[1].title()) 
- *3.1.3 Index Positions Start at 0, Not 1*:
    - 3.1.3.1 Lists are Zero-Indexed: A list's index positions always start at 0 and go to n-1.
    - 3.1.3.2 Index -1: You can access the last item of a list using the index -1. 
- *3.1.4 Using Individual Values From a List*:
    - 3.1.4.1 List Item Application: You can use list elements like variables. See the bicycles.py file for the corresponding example.
**3.2 Changing, Adding, and Removing Elements**
- *3.2.1 Modifying Elements in a List*:
    - 3.2.1.1 
- *3.2.2 Adding Elements to a List*:
    - 3.2.2.1 Appending Elements to the End of a List
    - 3.2.2.2 Inserting Elements Into a List
- *3.2.3 Removing Elements from a List*:
    - 3.2.3.1 Removing an Item Using the del Statement
    - 3.2.3.2 Removing an Item Using the pop() Method
    - 3.2.3.3 Popping Items from any Position in a List
    - 3.2.3.4 Removing an Item by Value
- *3.2.4 Organizing a List:*
- *3.2.5 Modifying Elements in a List*:
