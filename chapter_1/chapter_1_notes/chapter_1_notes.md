**Ch.1 Getting Started**

**1.1 Setting Up Your Programming Environment**
- *1.1.1 Python Versions*: Ensure you install the most up-to-date or at least a recent version.
- *1.1.2 Running Snippets of Python Code*: You can run snippets of code via the terminal once you have python installed. 
    1.1.2.1 You can run code snippets such as:
    python
    print("Hello python interpreter!")
    Hello python interpreter!
    1.1.2.2 You can also run code snippets contained in actual python files held on your machine via the terminal (more on that later)
- *1.1.3 Sublime text editor*: I won't be using that, so sections pertaining to that won't be covered in my notes.

**1.2 Python on Different Operating Systems**
- *1.2.1 Checking Your Version of Python*: On Windows you just write python into the terminal window
- *1.2.2 Running Python in a Terminal Session*: Run the example 1.1.2.2 to ensure python is installed

**1.3 Running a Hello World Program**
- *1.3.1 Running hello_world.py*: This section focuses more on using sublime text with the terminal. The next section showcases a series of commands for interacting with the program via the terminal.

**1.4 Troubleshooting**
- *1.4.1 Troubleshooting*: Don't be averse to asking questions, thoroughly reviewing code, or trying new things when writing code.

**1.5 Running Python Programs From a Terminal**
- *1.5.1 Running hello_world.py*: The book talks about using the terminal and sublime text, but there's other ways to run this python file. They are as follows:
    - *1.5.1.1 Run it Through The Terminal*:
       Assuming there is already a file for python work
       cd C:\path\to\your\python-directory
       New-Item -Path "your_script.py" -ItemType File
       notepad your_script.py
       python your_script.py
    - *1.5.1.2 Run it Through Your IDE*: Open the file in your IDE then run it.
