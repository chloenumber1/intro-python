**Ch.4 Working With Lists**

**4.1 Looping Through an Entire List**
- *4.1.1 A Closer Look at Looping*:
    - 4.1.1.1 The for loop: a for loop is the first control structure being introduced. The purpose of a for loop is to iterate over an iteratable object (in this case a list, but more generally a sequence). The primary objective of a for loop is to automate repetitive tasks (such as accessing elements in a list, printing statements repeatedly, etc.).
    - 4.1.1.2 Explaining the for loop syntax by breaking it into components:
        - 4.1.1.2.1 Start with an example
        
        for variable in sequence:
        
            &lt;code block that will be executed&gt;
        - 4.1.1.2.2 Keyword for: The keyword "for" initiates the for loop
        - 4.1.1.2.3 variable: "variable" is a placeholder that represents the current item in the sequence during each iteration.
            - 4.1.1.2.3.1 More on "variable": It's called a placeholder variable because it doesn't have a fixed value throughout the loop. Its value changes with each iteration. So, the variable "variable" is essentially a container that's filled with a new item from the list in each pass of the loop.
        - 4.1.1.2.4 Keyword in: The keyword in is used to specify that the variable will iterate over the given sequence.
        - 4.1.1.2.5 sequence: "sequence" is what's being iterated over and it can be any iteratable object. 
        - 4.1.1.2.6 colon (:): The colon marks the end of the for statement
        - 4.1.1.2.7 code block to be executed: The code block indented under the for statement will be executed for each item in the sequence.
