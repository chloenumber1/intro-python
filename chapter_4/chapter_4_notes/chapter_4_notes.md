**Ch.4 Working With Lists**

**4.1 Looping Through an Entire List**
- *4.1.1 A Closer Look at Looping*:
    - 4.1.1.1 The for loop: a for loop is the first control structure being introduced. The purpose of a for loop is to iterate over an iteratable object (in this case a list, but more generally a sequence). The primary objective of a for loop is to automate repetitive tasks (such as accessing elements in a list, printing statements repeatedly, etc.).
    - 4.1.1.2 Explaining the for loop syntax by breaking it into components:
        - 4.1.1.2.1 Start with an example
        for variable in sequence:
            # code block that will be executed
        - 4.1.1.2.2 Keyword for: The keyword "for" initiates the for loop
        - 4.1.1.2.3 variable: "variable"
