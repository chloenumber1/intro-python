# This is a supplemental review of everything I've covered in 
# Ch.1 through Ch.4.

# Ch.1 was an intro, so I won't be doing review questions 
# for that chapter.

# Ch.2 covered variables, Strings, numbers, and comments.

# 2-1. Simple Message: Assign a message to a variable, and then print that 
# message.

# 2-2. Simple Messages: Assign a message to a variable, and print that 
# message. Then change the value of the variable to a new message, 
# and print the new message.

# 2-3. Personal Message: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, 
# and print a message to that person. Your message should be simple, 
# such as, “Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?”

# 2-4. Name Cases: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and then 
# print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and title case.

# 2-5. Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print 
# the quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something 
# like the following, including the quotation marks:
# Albert Einstein once said, 
#     “A person who never made a 
#     mistake never tried anything new.”

# 2-6. Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 2-5, but this time, represent the 
# famous person’s name using a variable called famous_person. 
# Then compose your  message and represent it with a new variable called 
# message. Print your message.

# 2-7. Stripping Names: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and 
# include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. 
# Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
# Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
# Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), 
# rstrip(), and strip()
