# 2-10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and 
# add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to 
# write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your 
# name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write 
# one sentence describing what the program does.
# All of my files have comments, so I'm skipping this TIY.

#  2-11. Zen of Python: Enter import this into a Python terminal session and skim 
# through the additional principles.

# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
# Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Explicit is better than implicit.
# Simple is better than complex.
# Complex is better than complicated.
# Flat is better than nested.
# Sparse is better than dense.
# Readability counts.
# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
# Although practicality beats purity.
# Errors should never pass silently.
# Unless explicitly silenced.
# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
# Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# Now is better than never.
# Although never is often better than *right* now.
# If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
# Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
