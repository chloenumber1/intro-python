**2.2 Variables**
- *2.2.1 Naming and Using Variables*:
    - 2.2.1.1 Variable names can only have letters, numbers, and underscores.
        - 2.2.1.1.1 Variables CAN start with a letter or underscore.
        - 2.2.1.1.2 Variables CANNOT start with a number.
    - 2.2.1.2 Spaces are NOT allowed in variable names (e.g. variable name) so use underscores as separators (e.g. variable_name)
    - 2.2.1.3 Do not use Python keywords and function names as variable names.
    - 2.2.1.4 Keep variable names short and descriptive.
    - 2.2.1.5 Try to careful when using 1, 0, O, and l since they can easily be confused.
- *2.2.2 Avoiding Name Errors When Using Variables*:
    - 2.2.2.1 "A traceback is a record of where the interpreter ran into trouble when trying to execute your code" (p.18).
    - 2.2.2.2 Ensure your variables are spelled correctly throughout your code to prevent errors.
- *2.2.3 Variables are Labels*:
    - 2.2.3.1 Variables are named spaces, meaning that they reference a stored value. Name your variables in a meaningful, descriptive way so your code is cleaner and so you can parse through errors more easily.
    - 2.2.3.2 Try-It-Yourself 2-1 and 2-2 are in this section. Refer to the ch2_try_it_yourself folder to see the files.
